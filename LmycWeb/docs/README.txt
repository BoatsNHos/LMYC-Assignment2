Completed: We have completed all of the database, login, register, and some Angular integration

Not completed: Localization, angular reservation?

Major Challenges:
The biggest challenge was to integrate Angular into the project. The biggest issue
for this is that we were unsure as to what mean by Angularizing "some" of the pages.
We were able integrate Angular into the project, however it was a troublesome for us
to divide the app into both ASP.NET Core views and Angular views as only some of the
pages were to be Angularized.
